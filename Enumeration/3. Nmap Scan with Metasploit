## ⚙️ Nmap Scanning Commands (run from shell)
Use these from your regular shell to perform scans and export results.

### Default Nmap Scan
```bash
nmap 10.4.22.173
```

### Nmap Scan without Ping Probe
```bash
nmap -Pn 10.4.22.173
```

### Service Version + OS Detection
```bash
nmap -Pn -sV -O 10.4.22.173
```

### Scan + Export to XML (for importing into Metasploit)
```bash
nmap -Pn -sV -O 10.4.22.173 -oX windows-ser.xml
```

## 🧭 Metasploit: Using `db_nmap` & Workspaces

> These commands are intended to be used **inside `msfconsole`** (except `service`/`msfdb init` which are run from shell).

### Start services & launch Metasploit (shell)
```bash
service postgresql start
msfconsole
# If DB is not initialized (Kali), run:
msfdb init
```

### Metasploit workspace & `db_nmap` commands (inside msfconsole)
```bash
workspace                # show current workspace
workspace -a Nmap_MSF    # create/select a new workspace named 'Nmap_MSF'
db_nmap -Pn -sV -O 10.4.22.173   # run nmap and import results into DB
hosts                    # list imported hosts
services                 # list discovered services
vulns                    # list discovered vulnerabilities
db_import /root/windows-ser.xml  # alternatively import an XML file
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Tip: When to use `db_nmap` vs `nmap` then import</strong></summary>

- `db_nmap` runs Nmap from within Metasploit and stores results automatically.  
- Running `nmap` externally with `-oX` gives you a portable XML file to keep in `scans/` and import later using `db_import`.

## 🧩 Notes & Best Practices

- `-Pn` treats hosts as online — use when ICMP or ping is blocked.  
- `-sV` detects service versions; `-O` attempts OS detection. Both can be noisy.  
- Use separate workspaces (`workspace -a <name>`) to isolate data per engagement.  
- Keep raw scan files (`.xml`, `.nmap`, `.gnmap`) in a `scans/` folder for traceability.  
- When importing to Metasploit, verify `db_status` to ensure DB connectivity.

## ✨ Make it look great on GitHub
- Place this `README.md` at the root of your repository — GitHub will render it automatically.  
- Store raw scan files in `scans/` and link them using relative paths for quick access.  
- Consider adding screenshots to `docs/` and referencing them in the README for visual clarity.
