🪟 Importing Nmap Scan Results into Metasploit

Step-by-Step Process

1. > service postgresql start                       # Start the PostgreSQL database service, which Metasploit uses to store all data.

2. > msfconsole                                     # Launch the Metasploit Framework console.

3. > db_status                                      # Check the status of the database connection (should show 'postgresql connected').

4. > workspace                                      # View the current active workspace (Metasploit's way of organizing data by project).

5. > workspace -a win2k12                           # Create a New Workspace named 'win2k12' and automatically switch to it.

6. > db_import /root/windows-ser.xml                # Import the Nmap scan results from the specified XML file into the active database/workspace.

7. > hosts                                          # Verify the import by listing all hosts added to the current workspace.

8. > services                                       # List all open services and ports discovered on the imported hosts.
