⚙️ Nmap Scanning Commands

1. Default Nmap Scan
> nmap 10.4.22.173                                 # Default Nmap Scan: Performs a SYN stealth scan (-sS) of the top 1000 TCP ports.

2. Nmap Scan without Ping Probe
> nmap -Pn 10.4.22.173                             # No Ping Probe: Skips the host discovery phase (-Pn) and assumes the target is online. Useful when ICMP is blocked.

3. Scan for Service Version and OS Detection
> nmap -Pn -sV -O 10.4.22.173                      # Service and OS Detection: Skips ping (-Pn), adds Service Version (-sV) and Operating System (-O) detection.

4. Scan and Export Results in XML Format
> nmap -Pn -sV -O 10.4.22.173 -oX windows-ser.xml  # Export to XML: Runs a full detection scan and exports the output to an XML file for later parsing (-oX).
